# Overview

Mattel Electronics sold the Aquarius computer in the 1980s.  This included a printer that sent RS-232 serial data but used 3.5mm and 2.5mm audio plugs rather than the standard DE-9 or DB-25 connectors.

Here are schematics for building either a wiring adapter to connect the Aquarius printer directly to a PC's 9-pin serial port or to the Intellivision ECS.  Note that similar schematics elsewhere don't allow a direct connection to a PC since they require additional adapters like null-modem cables.
